# Push Protocol Smart Contracts

Welcome to the repository for the smart contracts of the Push Protocol. This repository contains the core code that powers our decentralized communication network. The Push Protocol is a web3 communication protocol that enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for decentralized applications (dApps), wallets, and services.

Our smart contracts are the backbone of the Push Protocol, enabling the functionality that allows for on-chain and off-chain communication via user wallet addresses. This is done in an open, gasless, multichain, and platform-agnostic fashion.

In this repository, you will find the contracts that handle various aspects of the Push Protocol, from channel creation and verification to notification sending and subscription handling. We also provide a suite of tests to ensure the robustness and security of our contracts.

We invite you to explore, contribute, and help us build the future of web3 communication.

| EPNSCoreV1.Benchmark.test.js | The code snippet initializes and runs benchmarks to test the functionality of the EPNS smart contract. The tests involve creating channels and adding whitelisted addresses. The contract is deployed using a proxy contract, with arguments passed via arrays and functions executed using the AsyncFunction constructor. The aim is to test the time taken for each function to execute. The benchmarks are run against three different versions of the contract, allowing for comparisons on changes in functionality. | test/benchmarks/EPNSCoreV1.Benchmark.test.js |

| EPNSCommStorageV1_5.sol | This Solidity code defines a contract for storing and managing user data in the Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) protocol. It includes a User struct for organizing data about users and several mappings that track user and channel subscriptions. The contract also includes state variables for governance, user count, and more.                                                                                                             | contracts/EPNSComm/EPNSCommStorageV1_5.sol |
| EPNSCommAdmin.sol       | This code snippet is a Solidity contract that extends the ProxyAdmin contract from the OpenZeppelin library. Its main functionality is to serve as a proxy administrator for a smart contract system, allowing the updating and upgrading of contracts in the system, while maintaining the same deployment address and keeping the contract functionalities intact. The SPDX-License-Identifier is also included, specifying the open-source MIT license. | contracts/EPNSComm/EPNSCommAdmin.sol       |
| EPNSCommProxy.sol       | The provided Solidity contract is an implementation of a transparent upgradeable proxy using the OpenZeppelin library. It takes in parameters for the contract's logic, governance address, push-channel admin address, and chain name as part of its constructor function. Upon initialization, the contract transparently proxies its functionality, allowing future upgrades and modifications without breaking functionality or requiring migrations.  | contracts/EPNSComm/EPNSCommProxy.sol       |

It uses the constructor to set various parameters, such as logic contract, governance address, WETH and DAI addresses, and initialization parameters by encoding values using abi.encodeWithSignature().                                                                                                                                                 | contracts/EPNSCore/EPNSCoreProxy.sol       |
| EPNSCoreStorageV2.sol   | The provided code defines a contract called EPNSCoreStorageV2 that has three state variables. It defines two types of byte32 hash constants and mappings for nonces, channel update counters and rewards claimed by addresses for channel creation. It specifies the Solidity compiler version to be used as greater than or equal to 0.6.0 and less than 0.7.0.                                                                                                                           | contracts/EPNSCore/EPNSCoreStorageV2.sol   |

| envVerifier.js         | This code exports a function that verifies and generates an environment file by checking for its presence, reading a version-controlled sample file, prompting the user with any variables not found in the environment file, and building the real environment file by appending real environment variable values entered by the user. The function returns null when the environment is verified or generated. The'chalk' package outputs pretty terminal messages, and the script has the option to fail or log on non-verification of environment variables.        | loaders/envVerifier.js         |
| versionVerifier.js     | This code snippet provides a set of functions to verify and upgrade a version of a configuration file, using properties of said file and verified parameters. The code reads a contract configuration file in json format and checks a version history. If there is a version upgrade, it makes necessary JSON changes to double-check the data, overwriting parameters read previously, thus keeping errors at bay. The file mostly relies on third-party of close source modules and deals extensively with monitoring and reporting errors generated in the process. | loaders/versionVerifier.js     |
| tokenAmountVerifier.js | This code snippet exports a function "verifyTokensAmount", which uses the "DISTRIBUTION_INFO" constant to calculate the total distributed token amount and verify if it matches the expected total. The function achieves this by recursively iterating over the "DISTRIBUTION_INFO" object and returns an error and exits the process if the total amount is incorrect. The code utilises the "chalk" library for formatting output to the console.                                                                                                                    | loaders/tokenAmountVerifier.js |

| IUniswapV2RouterMock.sol | The provided code snippet is a Solidity interface for the UniswapV2RouterMock contract. It defines two function signatures: swapExactTokensForTokens for swapping tokens and getAmountsOut for calculating the expected output amounts when swapping tokens. The provided interface acts as a blueprint for any contract implementing the UniswapV2RouterMock interface, allowing them to interact with other contracts that require this functionality.                                        | contracts/mocks/IUniswapV2RouterMock.sol |
| MockERC1271.sol          | The provided code defines the "SignatureVerifier" contract, which verifies whether a given signature is valid for a specified hash corresponding to the contract's owner address. The contract uses the openzeppelin ECDSA library and supports the ERC1271 standard for signature validation. The "supportsStaticCall" function checks whether a given method ID belongs to the ERC1271 interface, while the "isValidSignature" function verifies if the signature matches the expected owner. | contracts/mocks/MockERC1271.sol          |
| MockDai.sol              | The code provides a smart contract that allows for the minting of ERC20 tokens and is used as a mock version of DAI stablecoin. The `MintableERC20` abstract contract, derived from `ERC20`, enables tokens to be minted and the `MockDAI` contract inherits from it with the name "DAI" and ticker "DAI". This contract could be used in place of real DAI tokens for testing and development of decentralized applications.                                                                   | contracts/mocks/MockDai.sol              |
